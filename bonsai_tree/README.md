You are an aspiring botanist and you are starting to take notes of the various botany facts related to [bonsai trees]()

## Task

Create a new file titled `dangers-to-bonsais.txt` on the `main` branch with the following text:

```text
Bonsai trees are delicate and vulnerable to threats like overwatering, pests, fungal infections, and extreme temperatures. Poor pruning or wiring can cause lasting damage, while dehydration and root rot are common killers. Without careful maintenance, these miniature trees can quickly decline.
```

Create a new branch `history` and add another file `history-of-bonsais.txt` with the following text:

```text
Bonsai originated in China over a thousand years ago as "penjing," the art of miniature landscape cultivation. The practice later spread to Japan, where it evolved into the refined bonsai we know today, emphasizing simplicity, balance, and harmony with nature. Traditionally associated with Zen Buddhism, bonsai became a symbol of patience and artistic expression. Over time, it gained global popularity, with enthusiasts worldwide cultivating these miniature trees as a blend of horticulture and art.
```

Finally, create a final branch that goes off of `history` called `care` and edit the empty `bonsai-care.txt` file with the following text:

```text
Proper bonsai care involves balancing water, light, and nutrients to maintain a healthy tree. Bonsais require well-draining soil and regular watering, but overwatering can lead to root rot. They need adequate sunlight, with indoor varieties thriving near bright windows and outdoor species requiring seasonal adjustments. Pruning and wiring help shape the tree, while repotting every few years ensures root health. Protecting bonsais from pests, extreme temperatures, and diseases is essential for their longevity, making their care both an art and a discipline.
```

Ultimately, your Git tree should look like this:
